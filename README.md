> Waitstaff is a service that allows restaurants to easily extend online ordering options to their customers. By signing up, restaurants can bring their business to the masses and generate a mobile applications for ordering on the go. In addition, Waitstaff provides a simple and complete API for your existing restaurant website to connect to for online ordering and financial management.

Everything's all wrapped up with the website besides the API. The whole mobile application part never fully came to fruition â€” the start of an iOS app template is lying around somewhere.
